Whenever something goes wrong with an API request, the server returns an error. Information about the error is indicated by an HTTP status code, with further details in the response body, which will be a JSON resource.

Errors share the same common attributes as other API resources; they have a `sys` property, where `sys.type` is always `"Error"` and `sys.id` identifies the exact error code (see tables below) that occurred. They also always have a `message` property which will be a short description of what went wrong.

Errors resulting from bad input (such as `ValidationFailed` errors) contain a `details` property. This property is structured data that indicates more precisely what was wrong with the input.

### Shared error types

HTTP Status Code |Error Code       |Description
-------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`400`|`BadRequestError`|The request was malformed or is missing a required parameter.
`400`|`InvalidQueryError`|The request contained invalid or unknown query parameters.
`401`|`AccessTokenInvalidError`|The authorization token was invalid.
`403`|`AccessDeniedError`|The user tried to access a resource that they do not have access to. This could include a missing role.
`404`|`NotFoundError`|The requested resource or endpoint could not be found.
`422`|`ValidationFailedError`|The triggered query references an invalid field.
`429`|`RateLimitExceededError`|The user sends too many requests per second.
`500`|`ServerError`|Something went wrong on our end.
`502`|`AccessDeniedError`|The space has not been used for a long time and hence it has been hibernated, but it will reappear if the user begins using it again.
