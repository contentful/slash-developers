## Common Resource Attributes

Every resource returned by the API will have a `sys` property, which is an object containing system managed metadata. The exact metadata available depends on the resource type, but at minimum it defines the `sys.type` property.

**Note**: None of the `sys` fields are editable and you can only specify the `sys.id` field when creating an item (as long as it's not a Space).

The `sys.id` property will be defined for every resource that is not a collection. For example, a `Space` resource will have a `sys.type` and `sys.id`:

```
{
  "sys": {
    "type": "Space",
    "id": "cfexampleapi"
  }
}
```
