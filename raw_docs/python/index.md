## SDKs

Our SDKs give you access to our [APIs](/developers/docs/concepts/apis/) and their features.

### CDA - Content Delivery API

Contentful's Content Delivery API (CDA) is a read-only API for retrieving content from Contentful. All content, both JSON and binary, is fetched from the server closest to an user's location by using our global CDN.<br/>
