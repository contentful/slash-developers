## SDKs

Our SDKs give you access to our [APIs](/developers/docs/concepts/apis/) and their features.

### Content Delivery API SDK

This SDK interacts with the Content Delivery API, a read-only API for retrieving content from Contentful. All content, both JSON and binary, is fetched from the server closest to a user's location using our global CDN.<br/>
