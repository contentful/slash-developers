## SDKs

Our SDKs give you access to our [APIs](/developers/docs/concepts/apis/) and their features.

{: .note}
**Note**: We don't have an official .NET SDK, but if you would like to start developing, you can use the [HTTP endpoints](/developers/docs/concepts/apis/) or the third party SDK listed below, which is **not supported**.

### Content Delivery API SDK

This SDK interacts with the Content Delivery API, a read-only API for retrieving content from Contentful. All content, both JSON and binary, is fetched from the server closest to a user's location using our global CDN.
