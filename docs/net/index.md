## SDKs

Our SDKs give you access to our [APIs](/developers/docs/concepts/apis/) and their features.

### Content Delivery and Content Management APIs SDK

This SDK interacts with the Content Delivery (CDA) and Content Management (CMA) APIs.

The CDA is a read-only API for retrieving content from Contentful. All content, both JSON and binary, is fetched from the server closest to a user's location using our global CDN.

The CMA integration allows you to create, edit, manage, and publish content, and offers tools for managing editorial teams and cooperation.
