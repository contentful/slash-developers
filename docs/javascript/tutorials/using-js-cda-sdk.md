## Overview

Contentful's Content Delivery API (CDA) is a read-only API for retrieving content from Contentful. All content, both JSON and binary, is fetched from the server closest to an user's location by using our global CDN.

In order to makes things easier for our users, we publish SDKs for various languages which make the task easier.

This article goes into detail about how to get content using the [JavaScript CDA SDK](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.js).

## Pre-requisites

In this tutorial, it is assumed you have understood the basic Contentful data model as described above and in the [developer center](/developers/docs/concepts/data-model/).

## Authentication

To get started, for every request, clients [need to provide an API key](/developers/docs/references/authentication/), which is created per space and used to delimit audiences and content classes.

You can create an access token using the [Contentful web app](https://be.contentful.com/login) or the [Content Management API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/#/reference/api-keys/create-an-api-key)

## Setting up the client

First off, you need to get the SDK and use it in your project.

### In node.js

If you are running your code in node.js, all you have to do is install the npm package and require it in your code:

~~~ bash
npm install contentful
~~~

~~~ javascript
// main.js
var contentful = require('contentful')
~~~

### In a browser

If you are running your code in a web page, there are multiple ways you can get it ready to use.

The quickest and easiest way is to use the pre-built and minified JavaScript file from a CDN:

~~~html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/contentful@latest/browser-dist/contentful.min.js"></script>
~~~

The recommended way would be to also manage your browser JavaScript code and dependencies with npm and use a build tool such as browserify or webpack.

In that case, you'd need to first install the package:

~~~bash
npm install contentful
~~~

Then you can use it in your code

~~~javascript
// main.js
var contentful = require('contentful')
~~~

And finally build and use your file:

~~~bash
webpack main.js bundle.js
# or
browserify main.js -o bundle.js
~~~

~~~html
<script src="bundle.js"></script>
~~~

## Initializing the client

In order to be able to access your content, you need to create a client with the necessary credentials.

Having the API key you created before and the space ID, you can initialize your client:

~~~javascript
var client = contentful.createClient({
  space: 'mo94git5zcq9',
  accessToken: 'b933b531a7f37efbfc68838d24b416ddb3d53ea16377606045d3bfcdf705b0fb'
})
~~~

See the [reference documentation](https://contentful.github.io/contentful.js/contentful/latest/contentful.html) for more options.

## Requesting a single entry

Once you have a client you can start getting content.

In order to retrieve a specific entry, you need the ID for that entry. If you're looking at an entry you created in the Contentful web app, it should be the string in the URL after `/entries/`. In this particular case we have an entry read to be retrieved with the id `O1ZiKekjgiE0Uu84oKqaY`.

~~~javascript
client.getEntry('O1ZiKekjgiE0Uu84oKqaY')
.then(function (entry) {
  // logs the entry metadata
  console.log(entry.sys)

  // logs the field with ID title
  console.log(entry.fields.title)
})
~~~

The object received by the Promise callback represents the Entry `O1ZiKekjgiE0Uu84oKqaY` and contains two objects: `sys`, describing system properties of the entry, and `fields`, assigning specific values to fields (`title`,`body`,`image`) of its content type (`Blog Post`).

For more details on the information contained on `sys` check out the [common resource attributes](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/introduction/common-resource-attributes) on the CDA API reference or the entities definitions on the [SDK reference](https://contentful.github.io/contentful.js/contentful/latest/Entities.html)

## Retrieving all entries of a space

Now we're going to retrieve all the entries in a space.

~~~javascript
client.getEntries()
.then(function (entries) {
  // log the title for all the entries that might have it
  entries.items.forEach(function (entry) {
    if(entry.fields.title) {
      console.log(entry.fields.title)
    }
  })
})
~~~

It's very similar to getting a single entry, except you'll get an array with all the retrieved entries, and some parameters relevant to [pagination](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/introduction/collection-resources-and-pagination).

By default you get 100 entries. If you'd like to retrieve more, you can skip the first 100. You can also retrieve more than 100 entries per request, up to 1000.
~~~javascript
client.getEntries({
  skip: 100,
  limit: 200,
  order: 'sys.createdAt'
})
.then(function (entries) {
  console.log(entries.items.length) // 200
})
~~~

Don't forget to also specify an ordering parameter to get more predictable results. You can read more about ordering parameters in the [search parameters API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters/order) reference.

## Retrieving linked entries

Some entries might have links to each other, so when you retrieve a list of entries, those links are automatically resolved so you don't have to go look for the linked entry separately.

By default, one level of linked entries or assets are resolved.

The following example demonstrates the usage of a linked asset on field `image`:

~~~javascript
client.getEntries()
.then(function (entries) {
  // log the file url of any linked assets on field `image`
  entries.items.forEach(function (entry) {
    if(entry.fields.image) {
      console.log(entry.fields.image.fields.file.url)
    }
  })
})
~~~

If you'd like to have additional levels of links resolved, or none at all, you can use the include parameter:

~~~javascript
client.getEntries({include: 0})
.then(function (entries) {
  // Link wasn't resolved, so it only contains the asset metadata
  console.log(entries.items[0].fields.image.sys.id)
})
~~~

You can also turn off link resolution when you initialize the SDK or with a `resolveLinks` property on every request.

Check the [links reference page](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/links/) for more information on linked entries.

## Retrieving entries with search parameters

The entries method can also take additional parameters for filtering and querying. You can also use those same parameters when getting assets or content types.

The following request filters all entries by a specific content type, using that content type's ID:

~~~javascript
client.getEntries({
  'content_type': '6tw1zeDm5aMEIikMaCAgGk'
})
.then(function (entries) {
  // Only entries of the Blog Post content type
  console.log(entries)
})
~~~

You can also filter by properties of your entries:

~~~javascript
client.getEntries({
  'sys.id': 'O1ZiKekjgiE0Uu84oKqaY'
})
.then(function (entries) {
  // Only entries of the Blog Post content type
  console.log(entries)
})
~~~

Apart from simple equality filters, you can also use operators. This is the reverse of the previous example, except it will give you any entries where `sys.id` is not equal (`[ne]`) to the specified id.

~~~javascript
client.getEntries({
  'sys.id[ne]': 'O1ZiKekjgiE0Uu84oKqaY'
})
.then(function (entries) {
  // All entries but the one specified
  console.log(entries)
})
~~~

If you want to filter by any of the fields, you'll also need to specify the content type, as fields are not the same across all content types:

~~~javascript
client.getEntries({
  'content_type': '6tw1zeDm5aMEIikMaCAgGk',
  'fields.image.sys.id': '1Idbf0HVsQeYIC0EmYgiuU'
})
.then(function (entries) {
  // Only entries which link to the specified image
  console.log(entries)
})
~~~

There are many more search filters and operators you can use. You can perform the following kinds of searches:

* [Equality/inequality](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters/equality-operator) ([as well as in array fields](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters/array-equalityinequality))
* [Inclusion/exclusion](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters/inclusion)
* [Ranges](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters/ranges)
* [Full text search](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters/full-text-search)
* [Geo location searches](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters/location-proximity-search)
