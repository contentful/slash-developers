This guide will walk you through your first steps using Contentful within a Express js application. It will provide a step-by-step guide on how to get your first entries and start using the content you create on Contentful.

## Requirements

- A [Heroku][1] account
- [Node.js] [2]
- [Npm] [13]
- [Git][12] installed
- Basic Command Line Interface knowledge

## Start from a demo application

First we'll start with a [demo project][3], which is a simple Express js application using Contentful's 'Product Catalogue' template, so that you can see it running for yourself.

Run the following commands to get started.

- Clone the example repository:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/contentful/contentful_express_tutorial.git
~~~

- Navigate into the repository's directory:

~~~bash
$ cd contentful_express_tutorial
~~~

- Install dependencies:

~~~bash
$ npm install
~~~

- Run the server:

~~~bash
$ npm run dev
~~~

Everything is now set up. You can view your new data by opening [_http://localhost:3000/_][4] in your browser.

It should look something like this:

### Using your own content

You can create your own custom data by following these steps:

- Create an account with [Contentful][6] or [Log In][5].
- Create a new Space with the 'Product Catalogue' template, name it whatever you like.
- In the Express js application:
  - navigate to the package.json file open it and change the values `accessToken` and `space` in the `config` section and save.
  - run `npm run dev` to start the server
  - Your space will be now displayed in your application

Next in the _[Contentful web app][6] > Content_:

- Open the product called 'Playsam Streamliner Classic Car, Espresso'.
- Change the value of the _Product name_ field to a new value,
- Click the _Publish changes_ button./Users/kgarbaya/Desktop/full-stack-getting-started/create-your-own-expresjs-app.md
- Wait a few seconds for the changes to propagate to the CDN.
- Reload your Express js application and you will see the new product name.

You can continue to edit your content inside the [Contentful web app][13] and see the content change inside your Rails application.

### Deploy the demo to Heroku

To view the demo application live in your own production environment, follow these steps:

- Install [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line#download-and-install) if you don't already have it.
- Login to Heroku if you're not already:

~~~bash
heroku login
~~~

- Create a new instance:

~~~bash
heroku create
~~~

- Commit your change:

~~~bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Website"
~~~

- Deploy to Heroku:

~~~bash
git push heroku master
~~~

- Open the application in your browser:

~~~bash
heroku open
~~~

## Next Steps
