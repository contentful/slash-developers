## SDKs

Our SDKs give you access to our [APIs](/developers/docs/concepts/apis/) and their features.

### Content Delivery API SDK

This SDK interacts with the Content Delivery API, a read-only API for retrieving content from Contentful. All content, both JSON and binary, is fetched from the server closest to a user's location using our global CDN.<br/>

### Content Management API SDK

This SDK interacts with the Content Management API, and allows you to create, edit, manage, and publish content. The API also offers tools for managing editorial teams and cooperation.<br/>
