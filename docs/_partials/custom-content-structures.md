## Custom content structures

Contentful is built on the principle of structured content, a set of key-value pairs is not a great interface to program against if the keys and data types are always changing.

The same way you can set up any [content structure](/developers/docs/concepts/data-model) in a MySQL database, you can set up a custom content structure in Contentful. There are no presets, templates, or similar, you can (and should) set everything up depending on the logic of your project.

You maintain this structure with _content types_, which define what data fields are present in a content entry.
