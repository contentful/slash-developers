Contentful's Content Delivery API (CDA) is a read-only API for retrieving content from Contentful. All content, both JSON and binary, is fetched from the server closest to an user's location by using our global CDN.

We publish SDKs for various languages to make developing applications easier.

## Pre-requisites

This tutorial assumes you have read and understood [the guide that covers the Contentful data model](/developers/docs/concepts/data-model/).

## Authentication

For every request, clients [need to provide an API key](/developers/docs/references/authentication/), which is created per space and used to delimit applications and content classes.

You can create an access token using the [Contentful web app](https://be.contentful.com/login) or the [Content Management API](/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/#/reference/api-keys/create-an-api-key).
