This guide will show you how to get started using our [Ruby SDK](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.rb) to consume content.

Contentful's Content Delivery API (CDA) is a read-only API for retrieving content from Contentful. All content, both JSON and binary, is fetched from the server closest to an user's location by using our global CDN.

We publish SDKs for various languages to make developing applications easier.

## Pre-requisites

This tutorial assumes you have read and understood [the guide that covers the Contentful data model](/developers/docs/concepts/data-model/).

## Authentication

For every request, clients [need to provide an API key](/developers/docs/references/authentication/), which is created per space and used to delimit applications and content classes.

You can create an access token using the [Contentful web app](https://be.contentful.com/login) or the [Content Management API](/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/#/reference/api-keys/create-an-api-key).

## Installation

First, install the 'contentful' gem, with the terminal:

~~~bash
gem install contentful
~~~

Or you can add it to your _Gemfile_:

~~~ruby
gem 'contentful'
~~~

And run `bundle install` to install the gem and all its dependencies.

## Setting up the Contentful client

Once you have installed the gem, you can start using it inside your application.

## Initializing the client

You need an API key and a space ID to initialize a client

_You can use the API key and space ID pre-filled below from our example space or replace them with your own values.

~~~ruby
require 'contentful'

client = Contentful::Client.new(
  space: '71rop70dkqaj',
  access_token: '297e67b247c1a77c1a23bb33bf4c32b81500519edd767a8384a4b8f8803fb971',
  dynamic_entries: :auto
)
~~~

{: .note}
**Note**: The `dynamic_entries: :auto` attribute will automatically map the fields in your entries to methods, so that you can use them directly as objects.

## Getting your content

Contentful separates content between entries, which contain your data and relationships with other content or images, and assets, which represent static content, like images, and are served as files. Read more in our [content model guide][/developers/docs/concepts/data-model/].

### Entries

With the client created, you can now start consuming data from the API.

For example, to request all entries in a space from the API:

~~~ruby
entries = client.entries

entries.each do |entry|
  if entry.fields[:productName]
    puts entry.fields[:productName]
  end
end
~~~

~~~
Whisk Beater
Playsam Streamliner Classic Car, Espresso
Hudson Wall Cup
SoSo Wall Clock
~~~

Or to request a single entry:

~~~ruby
entry_id = '5KsDBWseXY6QegucYAoacS'
classic_car = client.entry(entry_id)

puts classic_car.fields[:productName]
~~~

~~~
Playsam Streamliner Classic Car, Espresso
~~~

You can specify any of the [query parameters accepted by the API][/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters], for example:

~~~ruby
products_by_price = client.entries(content_type: '2PqfXUJwE8qSYKuM0U6w8M', order: 'fields.price')

products_by_price.each do |entry|
  if entry.fields[:productName]
    puts entry.fields[:productName]
  end
end
~~~

~~~
Hudson Wall Cup
Whisk Beater
Playsam Streamliner Classic Car, Espresso
SoSo Wall Clock
~~~

### Using your entry as a Ruby object

Once you have your entry, you can use it as a Ruby object that follows standard Ruby conventions:

~~~ruby
puts product.product_name
puts "it costs #{product.price}"
puts "I am tagged with #{product.tags.join(' and ')}"
~~~

~~~
Playsam Streamliner Classic Car, Espresso
it costs 44
I am tagged with wood and toy and car and sweden and design
~~~

You can form complicated queries and interactions with your entries:

~~~ruby
products_with_many_tags = client.entries(content_type: '<content_type>', include: 2).select { |product| product.tags.size > 2 }
products_with_many_tags.each do |product|
  puts "I am tagged with #{product.tags.join(' and ')}"
  puts "My brand is #{product.brand.company_name}"
end
~~~

~~~
I am tagged with vase and flowers and accessories
My brand is: Normann Copenhagen
I am tagged with wood and toy and car and sweden and design
My brand is: Playsam
I am tagged with kitchen and accessories and whisk and scandinavia and design
My brand is: Normann Copenhagen
I am tagged with home d√©cor and clocks and interior design and yellow and gifts
My brand is: Lemnos

~~~

In this example you added the `include: 2` parameter, which allows the API to resolve [links][4] to other related entries.

## Using assets

You query assets in a similar way to entries, but the CDA offers more specific features, [such as filtering by the type of file](/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters/filtering-assets-by-mime-type/). You can also use our [Images API](/developers/docs/references/images-api/), that allows you to manipulate images as you retrieve them.

To query for a single asset:

~~~ruby
asset_file = client.asset('wtrHxeu3zEoEce2MokCSi').image_url
puts asset_file
~~~

~~~
//images.contentful.com/71rop70dkqaj/wtrHxeu3zEoEce2MokCSi/e86a375b7ad18c25e4ff55de1eac42fe/quwowooybuqbl6ntboz3.jpg
~~~

To query all assets in a space:

~~~ruby
assets = client.assets

assets.each do |abeausset|
  puts asset.image_url
end
~~~
