Webhooks extend the integration possibilities by notifying you, another person or system when content (assets, entries or content types) have changed by calling a pre-configured HTTP endpoint.

Whenever a matching event occurs, a webhook calls a specified URI to react. For example, every time a user edits an entry, sending a push notification or message to a Slack channel.

## Create and configure a webhook

### With the web app

In the top navigation bar, open _Settings_ â†’ _Webhooks_. Click _Add webhook_, configure the remote host, and click _Save_.

Creating a new webhook

You can configure the events that trigger a webhook at the bottom of the screen.

{: .note}
**Note**: The "Save" webhook is triggered when the entry (or an asset) has been saved with an API call, and "Autosave" is triggered when it's autosaved in the UI.

### With the API

Create a webhook by sending the settings for the webhook in a body with your API call, for example, the following:

~~~bash
curl -X POST "https://api.contentful.com/spaces/<SPACE_ID>/webhook_definitions"
  -d '{"url": "<URL>", "name": "foo", "topics": ["*.*"]}'
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>'
  -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.contentful.management.v1+json'
~~~

Will create a new webhook in the specified space with a `url`, `name`, and `topics` which match the configuration options mentioned above.

`topics` takes the form of comma separated `Type` and `Action` pairs, with `*` covering all actions, including any future actions Contentful introduces. For example, `ContentType.create` would trigger when someone creates a new content type, and `ContentType.*` would trigger for any of the five current actions.

## List webhooks in a space

### With the web app

The _Webhooks_ overview screen shows a list of the most recent webhook calls made, their status, possible errors, and the target URL.

### With the API

To list all webhooks in a space, use the following endpoint:

~~~bash
curl -X GET "https://api.contentful.com/spaces/<SPACE_ID>/webhook_definitions"
-H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>"
-H "Content-Type: application/vnd.contentful.management.v1+json"
~~~

## Activity log of a call

### With the web app

Click the _View details_ link of any webhook in the overview screen to get a detailed activity log, including the JSON and remote server response.

~~~bash
curl -X GET "https://api.contentful.com/spaces/<SPACE_ID>/webhooks/<WEBHOOK_ID>/calls"
-H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>"
-H "Content-Type: application/vnd.contentful.management.v1+json"
