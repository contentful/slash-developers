Webhooks in Contentful extend the integration possibilities by notifying you, someone, or something else when content (assets, entries or content types) have changed by calling a pre-configured HTTP endpoint.

Whenever a matching event occurs, you can set up a webhook that would call the specified URI to react. For example, every time a user edits an entry, send a push notification or message to a Slack channel.

## Create and configure a webhook

### With the web app

In the top navigation bar, go to _Settings_ â†’ _Webhooks_. Click _Add webhook_, enter the credentials of the remote host and whatever else is necessary for your environment, and click _save_.

{: .img-caption} Creating a new webhook

You can configure the events that trigger a webhook at the bottom of the screen.

{: .img-caption} Select what events trigger the webhook

{: .note} **Note**: The "Save" webhook is triggered when the entry (or an asset) has been saved with an API call, and "Autosave" is triggered when it's autosaved in the UI.

### With the API



Create a webhook by sending the settings for the webhook in a body with your API call, for example, the following:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.contentful.com/spaces/<SPACE_ID>/webhook_definitions"
  -d '{"url": "<URL>", "name": "foo", "topics": ["*.*"]}'
  -H 'Authorization:Bearer <API_KEY>'
  -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.contentful.management.v1+json'
```

Will create a new webhook in the specified space with a `url`, `name`, and `topics` which match the configuration options mentioned above.

`topics` takes the form of comma separated `Type` and `Action` pairs, with `*` covering all actions, including any future actions Contentful introduces. For example, `ContentType.create` would trigger when someone creates a new content type, and `ContentType.*` would trigger for any of the five current actions.

## List webhooks in a space


```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.contentful.com/spaces/<SPACE_ID>/webhook_definitions"
-H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>"
-H "Content-Type: application/vnd.contentful.management.v1+json"
-H "Cache-Control: no-cache"
-H "Postman-Token: 76454645-7aec-b2cf-e0de-625a8a179828"
```

### With the web app

The _Webhooks_ overview screen shows a list of the most recent webhook calls made, their status, possible errors, and the target URL.
