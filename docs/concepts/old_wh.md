Webhooks in Contentful help by responding to events such as "an entry was edited", and "an asset has been published/unpublished".

Whenever an event like this occurs, you can set up a webhook that will call a specified URI to somehow react. For instance, you can send a notification to a Slack channel every time someone edits an entry to be notified of changes.

Webhooks greatly extend the integration possibilities provided by Contentful.

## Setup

Go to _Settings_ â†’ _Webhooks_ from the navigation bar at the top. Click _Add webhook_, enter the credentials of the remote host and configure whatever else is necessary in your environment, and you're done.

**Note**: The "Save" webhook is triggered when the entry (or an asset) has been saved with an API call, and "Autosave" is triggered when it's autosaved in the UI.*
