Contentful is an API-first CMS, offering four REST APIs for working with your content. Each of these APIs serve a different purpose, so which one to use depends on what you want to do:

- If you're retrieving content to display to users in an app or website, you want to use the [Content Delivery API][cda-section].
- If you want to programmatically create or update content items, use the [Content Management API][cma-section].
- If you want to retrieve unpublished content to show in-context previews to content creators and editors, use the [Preview API][cpa-section]. This API behaves like the Content Delivery API, but includes content that has not yet been published.
- Finally, when retrieving images stored in Contentful, they will come from `images.contentful.com`. You can apply various transformations to images by appending query parameters to the URL, so we refer to this as our [Images API][images-section].

## Content Delivery API

The Content Delivery API (CDA), available at `https://cdn.contentful.com`, is a read-only API for delivering content from Contentful to apps, websites and other media. Content is delivered as JSON data; images, videos and other media are delivered as files.

The API is available via a globally distributed content delivery network. All content, both JSON and binary, is served from the server closest to where a user is requesting content from. This minimizes latency, which especially benefits mobile apps. Hosting content in multiple data centers around the world also greatly improves the availability of content.

## Content Management API

The Content Management API (CMA), available at `https://api.contentful.com`, is a read-write API for managing your content. Unlike the Content Delivery API, the management API requires you to authenticate as a Contentful user. It covers several use cases, such as:

 - Automatic imports from different CMSes like WordPress or Drupal.
 - Integration with other backend systems, such as an e-commerce shop.
 - Building custom editing experiences. In fact, we built the [Contentful web app](https://app.contentful.com) on top of this API.

**Note**: You can also use the Content Management API to retrieve content. It's used to only manage content, so it will retrieve **all** items (i.e. all localized and unpublished content).

## Preview API

The Preview API, available at `https://preview.contentful.com`, is a variant of the CDA for previewing your content before you deliver it to your customers. You use the Preview API in combination with a "preview" deployment of your website (or a "preview" build of your mobile app) that allows content managers and authors to view their work in-context, as though it was published. This API uses a "preview" access token to allow you to view unpublished content as though it were delivered by the CDA.

## Images API

With the Images API `https://images.contentful.com` you can resize and crop images, change their background color and convert them to different formats, PNGâ†’JPG, for instance. Using our backend for these transformations lets you upload high-quality assets, deliver exactly what your app needs, and still get all the benefits of our caching CDN.
