Whenever something goes wrong with an API request, the server produces an error. The error message contains an appropriate HTTP status code in the header and a JSON response in the body. The `sys` part of the JSON describes the error details.

The `sys.type` will always be *Error*, and the `sys.id` identifies the precise error that has occured. The error messages sometimes include more details about the error.

## Error types

The API has a set of well-defined errors that it responds with if something didn't work out.
